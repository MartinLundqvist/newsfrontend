Ideas: 
- Show as cloud (with links) DONE. But not with links...
- Change options to "english", "swedish", "swiss", etc. NOPE. 
- Fix localStorage issue when the filter has changed as part of an upgrade. DONE.
- Add a "show max headlines" option
- Refactor the Cloud / Content components so they re-use the existing news if they have been loaded. 
  Actaully, this would probably be a refactor of the NewsProvider interface....
- Add a status sticky at the bottom of the screen
  - Fetched XXX headlines
  - Issues detected with headlines from Sydsvenskan
